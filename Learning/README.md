# Inference

Program that fits binary datasets with a chosen spin model with any high order interactions.

## Requirements

The code uses the C++11 version of C++.

**To compile:**  `g++ -I /usr/local/include/eigen3/ -I ./LBFGSpp-master/include -O2 main.cpp Models.cpp ReadDataFile.cpp BoltzmannLearning_Ising.cpp BoltzmannLearning_ACE.cpp`

**To execute:** `./a.out`

## Examples

All the functions that can be used from `int main()` are declared at the beginning of the `main.cpp` file and described below.

For hands-on and simple tests of the program, check the examples in the `int main()` function of the `main.cpp` file.
