# SpinModels
General programs to generate or fit data with spin models with high order interactions.

## Contents of the repository:
This repository contains two programs placed each in a different folder:
  - the folder "GenerateData" contains a program that can generate data from a chosen spin model with any high order interactions;
  - the folder "Inference" contains a program that can fit binary datasets with a chosen spin mode with any high order interactions.
